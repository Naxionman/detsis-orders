## About this web app

This app was made to accomodate the needs of a small business in Naxos, Greece. It's totally custom-made and not very likely what you might be searching for! But maybe this can serve as a base for your own project, or just a reference for some of the most important aspects of similar businesses. All of the commments are written in english, though most of the front-end elements are greek.

If you find it useful help ypurself! If you have any questions that I may be able to answer don't hesitate to contact me at naxionman@yahoo.com

Happy coding!
